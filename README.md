# Terminal scavenger hunt
This project generates a folder structure to explore using `cd`, `ls`, etc. Meant to teach basic command-line navigation.

### Setup
Run `generate.py`. Either specify a seed, or leave it blank to set a random seed. Seeds allow one to share a certain scavenger hunt configuration.
