# Terminal scavenger hunt
This project generates a folder structure to explore using `cd`, `ls`, etc. Meant to teach basic command-line navigation.

### How to play
 - Clone the repository by running `git clone` in a terminal
 - Run `generate.py`. Either specify a seed, or leave it blank to set a random seed (seeds allow one to share a certain scavenger hunt configuration)
   - The seed `hamber` is recommended
 - Use `cd`, `ls`, `cat` and an image viewer to explore the generated folders and search for the Among Us files
